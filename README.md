# Experiments using D3 on VIVO data
Part experiment, and part demonstration, the code here is intended to explore the use of D3 on 
VIVO data. I would like to keep everything in Javascript -- using Ajax to make SPARQL queries
of VIVO SPARQL API or VIVO TPF endpoints, using JavaScript to prepare the data for D3, and then
for visualization.

Adding a bunch of files, will organize into working demos.
